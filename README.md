# Introduction
A very simple conflict resolution patch for the Septimus Wabbajack and Relics of Hyrule.

# Installation
Place at the end of the mod list, as it merges all relevant changes that Septimus makes to leveled lists.

Includes a file for Keyword Item Distributor that correctly passes survival and animated armory keywords to items.
