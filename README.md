# Introduction
A very simple conflict resolution patch for the Septimus Wabbajack and Relics of Hyrule.
Includes a file for Keyword Item Distributor that correctly passes survival and animated armory keywords to items.

# What is Relics of Hyrule

Pulled from the Mod Page.

> The people believed that the Hero of Time would again come to save them... But the hero did not appear...Faced by an onslaught of evil, the people could do nothing, but appeal to the gods. In their last hour, as doom drew near, they left their future in the hands of fate. What became of that kingdom...? None remain who know."
> 
> These are the Relics of Hyrule, the shards of an age long forgotten, the remnants of a civilization older than the Dwemer. So old that it was a myth during their time, and little evidence of the civilization remains. All that remain are artifacts: weapons, armor, magic. As you travel through Skyrim, you will stumble across pieces of a long-lost civilization, and will eventually discover what led to its demise.
> 
> Unlike similar mods, Relics of Hyrule does not turn Skyrim into a Zelda game, nor does it use the Skyrim
engine to remake any Zelda game.
> 
> Such an approach, I feel, would be a pale imitation of Zelda, and would greatly reduce the quality of the mod.
> 
> My philosophy is that a Skyrim mod should respect the milieu and story of the core game, rather than using it as a simple technological platform to remake
another. I chose to make Relics of Hyrule the way it is after seeing many other mods based on the Legend of Zelda ignore Skyrim's world. The mod also serves to re-imagine and frame the tragic beauty of Hyrule and Termina in the harsh landscapes of Skyrim and Solstheim. Relics of Hyrule adds items from Zelda to vanilla Skyrim locations, but I link them to the world as though they have always been in Skyrim, through lore and secrets. My goal is to make the mod lore-friendly, despite being inherently lore-breaking. It's designed such that you find the relics by playing Skyrim.. There are no quests that guide you, only rumors and forgotten myths (unless you read the Information Guide, of course). This is intentional, as an homage to how games used to be. The original Legend of Zelda did not hold your hand.
> 
> In short, Relics of Hyrule is a large mod that adds scores of new weapons, spells, enchantments, enemies, NPCs, dungeons, and experiences that are (hopefully) balanced with the base Skyrim game and integrated into its locations, while connecting Zelda lore to Elder Scrolls lore as a bit of fun that gained a little too much momentum. The mod has been actively expanding and evolving since August 2013 and will continue to grow in the future.
> 
> There are no new quests, new lands, or dialogue, and you will not see any main characters from the Zelda franchise in this mod.
